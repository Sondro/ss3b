_ Add version switch to command-line options (-v). Need to build version number update into release "process".

_ Add ability to provide exemption list in the pathsfile (perhaps prefix with a !). Or... use the --exclude-tag option of GNU tar (which is slick). Or do both. Will need to do more logging so admin can see what is excluded.

x BUG - the first item in the paths_list is being dropped on clean up
        (only seems to be if the first line is a single directory)
        This was only a bug in a sanity check on each pathsfile line. Disabled
        the check to "fix". Need to review - not sure if this is really
        needed.

x Check if full or diff and set flag (is it full back up day?)
x Need to set config var for full back up day -- also check to
  see if full backup was forced from CLI or it is the first
  ever run (could use a value in "initialized" trigger file).
x Get or set (new) setid.
x change the path/name of the backups so each host gets it's own directory in the bucket
x Ensure good logging of backup progress/process
- Ensure good use of debugging option throughout (e.g. DEBUG "something is happening.")

x Implement command line ability to force full backup
x Create setid tracking and logging
x Create filename mgmt based on hostname, setid, full or diff, and date.
x Confiuration of day to perform full back up, check and do full or
  differential
X Implement clean up and trap on ERR (and end with cleanup)
X Look into using openssl to encrypt instead of gpg
	encrypt: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file -out file.enc
	decrypt: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file.enc -out file
